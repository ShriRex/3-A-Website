     in a yellow wood,

     <br>
And

sorry I could not travel 
<br>
<br>
both

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        as I could <br>
        <br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br>
</p>
<p>
Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
Though as for that the passing there <br>
Had worn them really about the same, <br>
</p>
<p>
And both that morning equally lay <br>
In leaves no step had trodden black. <br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
</p>
<p>
I shall be telling this with a sigh <br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” <br>
I took the one less traveled by, <br>
And that has made all the difference. <br>
